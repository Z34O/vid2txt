# vid2txt
A video to ascii text art converter

## Installation
Windows OS not yet supported. Linux only.

Clone this repository and run main.py to open CLI

```$ git clone https://Z34O/vid2txt```

## Getting Started

```$ python main.py```

After running main.py, a command line interface will appear.

There are only 2 commands available making it very simple.

```> convert```

After running this command, it will ask for the video file to convert.

Make sure the video is in the same directory as main.py

Depending on how long the video, and what its size is, the conversion may take a long time.

vid2txt will ask you to resize the file. The smaller the width and height the faster it converts.

The converted video will be a folder containing .txt files called asv.

```> play```

Running this command will ask you to name what asv folder to play.

After specifying it automatically plays the asv folder.

It will also ask you how many frames to play. After converting a video to an asv, it will output how many frames were processed.
